# US_Airline_Passenger_Satisfaction_Analysis
Project analyzes US airline passenger satisfaction dataset from Kaggle via data science. Aims to find key factors &amp; build prediction model. Cleans data of missing values/outliers, does feature engineering, uses ML algorithms. Results help airlines improve service (e.g., in-flight, delays) for higher satisfaction.
